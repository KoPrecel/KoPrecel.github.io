# Introduction

I frequently start a post and edit them as I learn. As such, my posts are constantly updated but the post date stays in the past. Plus, if I learn something in the future, I want to revisit my old posts and add relevant information as needed. The thing is that I don't want to worry about manually changing the "Last Edited Date"; rather, I want it done automatically. Fortunately, there is a way to do exactly that on Hugo! Let's learn how to implement a last edited date, so that we can show how recent a post really is.
