As such, my posts are constantly updated but the post date stays in the past. Plus, if I learn something in the future, I want to revisit my old posts and add relevant information as needed. The thing is that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to worry about manually changing the &amp;ldquo;Last Edited Date&amp;rdquo;; rather, I want it done automatically. Fortunately, there is a way to do exactly that on Hugo!</description></item><item><title>Learning How To Make Hugo Posts with Markdown</title><link>https://koprecel.github.io/post/markdown-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 18:06:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://koprecel.github.io/post/markdown-tutorial/</guid><description>Introduction I created this blog to start journaling my programming experiences and keep a record of what I learn along the way. After a few hours of struggling with GitHub Pages and Hugo, this blog successfully went live! That being said, there is still a lot of work to do. The very first thing I need to work on is to learn how to make a post, so that I can write about things I learn in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
